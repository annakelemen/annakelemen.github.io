*Preparing an espresso*

**Pressure** and **resistance** are key to good espresso. Higher pressure speeds up extraction and pulls more oils and flavors from the coffee, creating a richer, more intense cup. Lower pressure slows extraction and can lead to under-extracted, sour flavors if not properly balanced. A finer grind increases resistance, building pressure and extracting a richer shot. A coarser grind lowers resistance, causing water to flow too quickly and under-extract the coffee. Tamping also affects resistance and should be consistent.


1. Check the water tank to ensure it has enough water.
2. Place the coffee cup on top of the machine to warm up.
3. Turn the machine on with the portafilter and wait for the machine to heat up. Once indicator light is on, the machine is ready to use.
4. Grind coffee. Per espresso use 1 measuring spoon of coffee beans.
5. Level and tamp the coffee evenly. 
6. Brew the espresso. The ideal pressure is 9 bars, but 8 - 14 bars is acceptable.
7. Remove portafilter, discard the grounds and clean the brewing group and filter using a brush and a damp cloth. 
8. Reinsert portafilter and turn off or keep machine on for further use.

Optional:  air before turning on. Open the wand, press both coffee and steam switches until water flows out. Close the steam wand and turn off switches.


*Frothing milk*
1. Check the water tank to ensure it has enough water.
2. Press the steam switch. The machine is ready for steaming once the indicator light turns on. 
3. Froth milk. Immerse the wand, after opening the steam to the right amount, lower the pitcher to keep the wand close to the surface. Tilt the bottom of the pitcher to left, to have a clockwise frothed milk foam. The air intake should not be too little or too much. Stop if the can gets too hot.
4. When finished, close the steam valve and clean the steam wand with a damp cloth.  Purge the steam wand.
5. Turn off the steam switch. 
6. Air: open the wand, press both coffee and steam switches until water flows out. Close the steam wand and turn off switches.

*Heart latte art*
1. **Prepare the milk**
Gently tap and swirl the jug to remove larger air bubbles.
2. **Mix the milk with the espresso**:
Hold the cup by the handle in your non-dominant hand and tilt it at a 30–40° angle. Begin pouring milk from a height to "stretch the canvas" and mix with the espresso — fill the cup about halfway. After tilting back, swirl to mix.
3. **Pour the design**:
Bring the pitcher close until it nearly touches the rim of the cup. Lower the tip into the center and start pouring slowly. Wiggle the pitcher gently while staying centered. As the milk rises, slowly tilt the cup back to level, raise the pitcher slightly, and finish with a quick, clean cut-through motion to form a heart.

*Maintenance and cleaning*

*Daily*
The filters should not be blocked. Wash with water and detergent, if needed. 
**Backflush**: insert the blind filter, let pressure build up, then immediately turn off. Wipe the brewing group with a cloth.

*Weekly*
1. **Backflush filter group**: clean group seal with the brash, and the group filter with a cloth. Add descaler into the blind filter according to instructions. Backflush 3-4 times without removing the portafilter. Then remove portafilter and rinse with hot water from the machine. Clean the brewing group and portafilter with a damp cloth. Backflush with water only 3-4 times. Discard the first espresso brewed.
2. **Backflush filters**: place filters and portafilter in descaler (concentration according to instruction) keeping the handle out of the liquid.  Wait 15 minutes then remove parts and rinse with plenty of warm water. Discard the first espresso brewed.
3. Clean the machine exterior with a microfiber cloth.
4. Clean the tray with detergent.

*Monthly*
1. Switch off the machine. Remove the tray, water tank, portafilter, then turn the machine upside down.
2. Remove the screws and shower plate. Place the screws in the blind filter. 
3. Clean the shower plate and screws with coffee fat remover. 
4. Wipe parts including the group seal dry. 
5. When reassembling, tighten screws only hand-tight.
6. **Clean the steam wand**: Steam the steamwand cleaning solution, let it sit, then clean the wand with clean steam. For a deeper clean, the tip of the wand may be unscrewed.

*Half a year*
1. **Replace ion-change filter**: immerse in water for 3 minutes, then install the new filter (use PLA930s or PLA930M).
2. **Descale using sulfamic acid**, including the steam circuit.

As a descaler use LujoClean powder, which is a mixture of sodium percarbonate and potassium carbonate. The reactions taking place are
$$ 2Na_2CO_3 \dot 3H_2O_2 \rightarrow 3 H_2O_2 + 4 Na^+ + 2 CO_3^{2-} $$ and '\\ce{K2CO3 + H2O -> 2 KOH + CO2}'.  Potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate are water softeners, since the calcium and magnesium ions are prescipated. For potassium carbonate $$ Ca(OH)_2 + K_2CO_3 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + KOH $$ and for $$ Mg(OH)_2 + K_2CO_3 \rightarrow MgCO3 + KOH $$. 
It is therefore very important to only use a minimal amount of descaler and wash thoroughly after use.
