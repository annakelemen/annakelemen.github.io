# The exposure triangle.

## 2025/04/19

Amidst unemployment and a burnout from a terrible work experience I decided to pursue long-lost hobbies: one of them being photography. Specifically street-photography. I like the idea of being constrained by circumstance in your creative pursuit. And so I went and got myself the Ricoh GR IIIx. 

The camera has a fixed focal length of 26.1mm (capturing wide-angles) with a maximum aperture of f/2.8.
