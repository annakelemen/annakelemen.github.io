Yellow onion skins dye the eggs a **reddish-brown** shade, while red onions can create a **deep red** or burgundy color. You can start collecting the onion skins as early as February and  store the skins in well-ventilated box to prevent mold. The two types of onion skins can be boiled separately, or together. If vinegar is added, the egg shell can be dissolved (CaCO3 + 2H+ -> Ca2+ + H20 + CO2) therefore increasing the surface area for painting. Onion skins contains quercetin, pelargonidin, malvidin, and cyanidin as dyes, but the quercitin is the dominant dye component. The lower pH also affects the colour of the cyanidin, shifting it to a red at lower pH, and violet at a neutral pH.


For the eggs, choose lighter-colored eggs. Clean the eggs and remove any writing. 
*Leaf-Printing Technique: Berzselés*:

Place leaves such as parsley leaf on the egg, wrap it tightly in pantyhose, and tie it with thread. Boil the eggs in the dye. After dyeing, polish the eggs with a piece of bacon rind for shine.

*Wax Techinque: Írókázás*:

For some of the eggs, blow out the contents. Melt the beeswax to draw the designs with the íróka. First, divide the egg by drawing a cross, then add the patterns. The writing tool is held perpendicular to the egg and the egg is rotated with the other hand. Examples for patterns: https://mek.oszk.hu/02900/02907/html/index.htm . Dye cold, so it does not melt the wax and dye the eggs. To remove the wax, place the eggs in the oven and wipe them clean with a cloth.
