**Yellow onion** skins dye the eggs a **reddish-brown** shade, while **red onions** can create a **deep red** or burgundy color.  Onion skins contains quercetin, pelargonidin, malvidin, and cyanidin as dyes, but the quercitin is the dominant dye component.  It is best to start collecting the onion skins as early as February and  store the skins in well-ventilated box to prevent mold. 

The two types of onion skins can be boiled separately, or together.  If vinegar is added, the egg shell can be dissolved (CaCO3 + 2H+ -> Ca2+ + H2O + CO2) therefore increasing the surface area for painting.  The lower pH also affects the colour of the cyanidin, shifting it to a red at lower pH, and violet at a neutral pH.

It is best to choose lighter-colored eggs. Before colouring the eggs, they are cleaned and any writing is removed.  There are two traditional decorative techniques in Hungary for egg-colouring.

*Berzselés*:

Place leaves such as parsley leaf on the egg, wrap it tightly in pantyhose, and tie it with a thread. Hard-boil the eggs in the dye. After dyeing, use a piece of bacon rind for shine.


*Írókázás*:

Blow out the content of the eggs. Melt beeswax to draw and draw the design with the íróka (the drawing tool). This is done by first, dividing the egg by drawing a cross, then adding the patterns. The tool is held perpendicular to the egg and the egg is rotated with the other hand. Examples for patterns can be found at https://mek.oszk.hu/02900/02907/html/index.htm . In this case it is important to dye cold, so the wax does not melt. To remove the wax, the eggs are placed in the oven and wiped clean with a cloth.


Happy Easter! Hristos vaskrese!
