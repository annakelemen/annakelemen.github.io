# Smell in the age of AI: What machines know about perfume

## 2025/04/19

- There is lack of available data to train on. 
- Effects in fine fragrance may be different than in say, candles.
- Isomers matter. Oddly enough, structure sometimes correlates, sometimes not.
- Current research: not really feature engineering, but leave it to the network: graph-neural networks (community-based)
- Which models work well for large amount of data: GNNs tend to work well for less data, difffusion models also work well for large amount of data
- We cannot really ignore the science, the data-set really matters.
- Experience seems to be, that functional groups are important.
- Osmo ignores the aspects such as volatility, receptor binding, neuron firing and rather asks people about the odor.
- Molecules as graphs (small molecules!  Aromachemicals: have to be small to diffuse well). For every atom store information about that atom. Pass messages along the edges of the graph (the bond). From there predict attribute (for example, is it cherry). Tell the model whether it is correct or not correct. The weights are updated. Then the weights become optimal for being able to attributes. 
- Smell is so subjective ! What is a clean smell? For someone in the world cinammon feels clean. 
- Olfaction neuroscience: You can separate the objectivity and subjectivity of a smell. You can train objective smell recognition. The likes and associations are very different. (What does this smell like? Do people like this?: separate questions. But if you combine them back for a product.
- One molecule, Two molecule: a mixture may smell complitely different. It is challenging. Up to a point. However there are biological effects. You can smell something but then not smell the other thing. How much of those effects are in the chemistry and how much is in the nose? Observer effect.
- Silent enhancers of smell-perception. They activate the olfactory bulb. Some molecules may even surpress each other but lead to a better smell experience. 
- Fixatives (fragrance lasts longer) and blooming (fragrance comes out fast -e.g. shower gels, soaps)  agents.  May be vapour pressure is getting affected? You add a big ingredient you block the receptor. But neurons are not fired. It's an active area of research in odour removal.
- ISO-E super: Some people don't even smell it. It is a complex molecule with mixture of isomers. Why could it be a fragrance by itself. Due to stereoisomers. Different ratios of those. You need a lot of it for smell. But this could be a problem for skin irritation or allergies (safety) but good if you sell it. 
- Ambroxan: Industracive, baccarat rouge. Or other fragrances that seem to be indestructible. Last forever. There is a balance between long-lasting but not too long. For example Galaxolide: does not biodegrade that well. Problem for the environment. There is a balance between these things. We want an intense smelling-molecule. Makes it safer for humans. Make sure that it lasts long but not indestruictible. 
- Are there modeling for longevity and safety: yes. Toxicity: genetic toxicity. Skin-sensitiser. Skin irritability (this seems to have regional variation). Also, building up allergies by overuse. Model for biodegradability. 
- Molecule intensity prediction: how intense will it smell. 
- For example can you replace ISO-E super? Safer if you find similar if more intense, less used.
- Hedione & Pheromones: pheromones come from bacterial and insect region: unconditional response to mating behaviour. However: for humans? Case of hexadetamol: effect molecule on human behaviour. 
- New flanker with captive Fiscol. 2024 introduced fiscol (fresher smell). It was discovered 20 years ago. Massive lawsuits. Captives: new, novel, potential molecules, synthetics. Is it the future of modeling?   
- A lot of the ingredients used now. Likely won't be available in 10 years. For example galaxolide, biogreadbility. What will be missing in 5-10 years? Lillial was banned in 2020 for example. 
- Replacement and new ingredients. 
- Are captives good for creativity? It's up to the perfumer.
- Intellectual property. Big fragrance houses have their own captive programmes. (Laundries, shampoos, soaps). No one can copy their scent. IP matters a lot. There is no protection against protection. But if you have a captive important for a note. 
- Is it maybe why dupe fails to deliver. Dupe companies by definition try to make a cheaper product.
- But even: having access to farmers. It is difficult to have access the right ingredient with high quality. 
- Symrise patented a very efficient production of Menthal. This really gave them an advantage. Natural vs. synthetics.
- Linalool is present in a lot of naturals. The route matters because the impurities will affect the effect of the product. Different suppliers or synthetically or production. If you are able to patent a given route. That will also give you IP and an advantage because no one else will be able to make it. 
- Very much focus on intense captives. Which then allow for use of more naturals. 
- Fragrances of past, cult ones. Become cult ones due to novel materials. 
- Modeling fragrances. 
- Perfumers are much better at creating fragrances. They do a lot of work on improving stability, small performance modifications. This is an area giving a lot of time: could be freed by AI. 
- Come up with perfume is fast, but testing takes a really long. 
- Briefs in the industry: nowadays often marketing. 
- Models can only do what they have seen. But they are not creative.
- There are so many perfumes. Niche perfumery. Can AI help with giving recommendations? 
- Similar enough, but novel enough. People have liked this so other things those people may like to.
