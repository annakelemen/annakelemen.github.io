# Smell in the age of AI: What machines know about perfume
## 2025/04/19
Artificial intelligence is being applied to various aspects of **fragrance**. One of the main issues is the lack of available **data** to train on. A natural question is: what are the main **features** that predict smell or other **olfactive** properties of **aromatic compounds**? But engineering features is too complex. The act of **smelling**—from **compound volatility** to **receptor binding** and **neurons firing**—is not straightforward. The company **Osmo** asks people directly about the **odor**.


In current research, **feature engineering** is often left behind. Instead, the **model** is expected to learn what matters. **Graph neural networks (GNNs)** are commonly used. **Molecules** are represented as **graphs**. For every **atom**, information is stored, and messages are passed along **bonds** (the edges of the graph). To predict an attribute (e.g. "does it smell like cherry?"), the model is told whether it’s correct, and weights are updated accordingly. Over time, the weights become optimal for predicting that **attribute**.


**GNNs** tend to work well when there is less data. **Diffusion models** perform better with larger datasets. However, the **science** cannot be ignored—what goes into the **training dataset** really matters.


Some **features** seem to matter more than others. **Isomerism** plays a role. So do **functional groups**. Oddly, **spatial structure** sometimes correlates with smell, sometimes it doesn’t.


**Smell is subjective**. What is a "clean" smell? For someone, it might be **cinnamon**. In **olfaction neuroscience**, it’s possible to separate the **objective** and **subjective** components of a smell. Whether people like it or what it reminds them of are separate questions. But eventually, those come back together when making a **product**.

The same **compound** can smell different depending on its **use**—fine **fragrance**, **candles**, **soaps**. Two **molecules** together may smell completely different from either alone. It’s a challenge. At some point, **biological effects** come in. One smell may suppress the perception of another. Is that in the **chemistry** or in the **nose**? It’s an **observer effect**.


There are **silent enhancers**—molecules that activate the **olfactory bulb** without having a smell themselves. Some molecules may **suppress** each other, yet improve the experience. There are also **fixatives** (which make a scent last longer) and **blooming agents** (which help the fragrance come out fast, like in soaps or shower gels). Possibly, **vapor pressure** is affected. Adding a large ingredient might block a receptor, but no neurons are fired. This is an **active area of research**, especially in **odor removal**.


Take **ISO-E Super**. Some people can’t smell it. It’s a **complex molecule** with a **mixture of isomers**. It may work as a fragrance on its own due to its **stereoisomers**—different ratios, different effects. A large dose is needed to perceive it, which raises issues like **skin irritation** or **allergies**. That’s a **safety** concern—but also a **commercial** advantage if it works well.


Another example is **Ambroxan**, used in **Baccarat Rouge**. Some molecules seem **indestructible**—they last forever. But there has to be a balance. **Galaxolide**, for instance, does not **biodegrade** well. That’s a problem for the **environment**. The goal is an **intense** smelling molecule that is **safe**, lasts **long enough**, but not **too long**.


There are **models** for **longevity** and **safety**: **toxicity**, **genetic toxicity**, **skin sensitization**, **skin irritability** (which can vary by region), and **allergy build-up** due to overuse. There are also models to assess **biodegradability**. Some models predict **molecule intensity**—how strongly it will smell. Small molecules are often needed in **aromachemicals**, as they **diffuse** well.


The question becomes: can **ISO-E Super** be replaced? Ideally, with something **safer**, **stronger**, and **less used**. Molecules like **hedione** raise questions around **pheromones**. These usually come from **bacteria** and **insects**, causing **unconditional** behavior like mating. In humans, the science is unclear, though cases like **hexadecanal** show some molecules can affect **human behavior**.


In 2024, a new flanker included a captive called **Fiscol**, offering a **fresher smell**. It was actually discovered 20 years ago. There were massive **lawsuits**. **Captives** are novel, synthetic molecules protected by **intellectual property**. They might represent the **future of modeling**.


Many ingredients used today likely won’t be available in 10 years. For instance, **Galaxolide** due to biodegradability concerns. **Lillial** was banned in 2020. There is an urgent need for **replacements** and **new ingredients**.


Whether captives are good for **creativity** depends on the **perfumer**. **IP** is critical. Big fragrance houses run their own **captive programs** for **laundries**, **shampoos**, and **soaps**. These molecules are protected—others can’t copy their **scent**. There’s no real protection against protection, but if a **captive** is essential for a fragrance, it gives a real **advantage**.


That may be why **dupe** products often fail. They try to make cheaper versions but don’t have access to the same **ingredients**. Even getting high-quality **natural ingredients** is difficult. Some companies, like **Symrise**, patent production routes—like for **menthol**—which gives them a significant **edge**.


In naturals like **linalool**, the production **route** matters. Impurities introduced along the way can affect the product. If one can **patent** the production route, it creates **IP** and **market protection**.


There’s a growing focus on **intense captives** that allow more **natural ingredients** in a formulation. Many **cult fragrances** of the past became iconic because of **novel molecules**.


**Modeling fragrances** has its limits. A model can only do what it has seen before. It is not **creative**. A perfume can be **proposed** quickly, but **testing** takes time. People are still much better at **creating**. **AI** can help with **testing**, not with creation.


In the industry, **briefs** are often driven by **marketing**. There are so many perfumes, especially in **niche perfumery**. One area where AI can help is in **recommendation systems**—finding scents that are **similar enough** to feel familiar but **novel enough** to be interesting. If people liked something, the model may suggest other things those people are likely to enjoy.
