# Chirality and Parity
## 2027/04/21

- light is an oscillation of electric and perpendicular to that an oscillation in the magnetic field
- unpolarized light is the superposition of light oscillating in all directions
- a filter restricts the oscillation into one direction
- polarized light - filter - gets blocked or lights get through if polarization matches
- sugar-water - before it was blocked, now it gets through - so changes the direction of the polarized light
- light: let's only consider electric field now.  Horizontal + vertical (two linearly polarized light, one of them is offset with a phase) polarization creates (clockwise or counter) circularly polarized light.
- superposition of circularly polarized light (cc and c) is linearly polarized light
- clockwise versus counterclockwise polarized light either 'matches' or not the handedness of the molecule. Light travels faster / slower dependent on the medium which affects its wavelength. 
- Index of refraction is higher for clockwise (counterclockwise) if the molecule is chiral which results in a phase shift for one and therefore re-creates the polarization 
- The sugar molecule does not have mirror symmetry - it has a handedness - it is chiral
- Therefore to 'undo' the effect, the mirror image would be needed to undo the effect. But because there is none (it is different??) the effect stays
- Enantiomers (mirror image pairs)
- Why are all the sugar molecules right handed? 
- Plants always make right-handed sugar via enzymes. They are themselves chiral. But always only one enzyme is present. This is homochirality. E.g. DNA is right-handed, proteins are left-handed (?? check this) - always one enantiomer. 
- Glucose always right-handed (D-Glucose, L-Glucose tastes the same but has no calories)
- Why homochirality? If there were two enantiomers we would need two different enzymes to metabolise the sugar.
- D-Mannose added to water, let it sit: fresh one is sweet, the one that sat for longer tastes bitter. 
- Fructose room temperature (cold) sweet and warm less sweet.
- Polarimeter measures optical rotation
- Mutarotation
- D-Glucose has alpha and beta form and interconverts and thermodynamic equilibrium. They are both D but have a different efficiency of rotation - the solution has the average.
- Crystallization: one form (different minimum on PES). 
- D and L does not correlate with the rotation direction (+/-)
- Natural products are often chiral. Take carvone
Carvone forms two mirror image forms or enantiomers: R-(−)-carvone, has a sweetish minty smell, like spearmint leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, has a spicy aroma with notes of rye, like caraway seeds.[5][6] The fact that the two enantiomers are perceived as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also been found to be able to discriminate between carvone enantiomers.
My favorite stereochemical example is "wine lactone," which is present in some white wines (Gewürtztraminer, Scheurebe) and has a sweet, coconut-like odor. Its odor threshold is an incredible 0.00001 nanograms/Liter of air. However, changing one chiral carbon center gives an isomer (epimer) that has an odor threshold of > 1000 ng/L (basically undetectable by the human nose) – a factor of 100 million fold difference in odor sensitivity just from one simple change! This illustrates, as Josh did, that your nose receptors are incredibly selective (constructed of chiral amino acids)!
A chiral molecule must not have:

A mirror plane (σ)

A center of inversion (i)

An improper rotation axis (Sn, includes mirror + rotation)

If a molecule has any one of those, it’s achiral.

It is interesting to note that important molecular prop-
erties (shape, handedness, atomic labels) break the fun-
damental symmetries of an isolated quantum system: the
rotational and inversion symmetry, as well as the indis-
tinguishability of identical particles. It remains a task to
explore on a detailed microscopic level how and why
these broken-symmetry states become pointer states of
a molecular system.


- good quantum numbers that do not change in time

Strictly speaking within parity conserving quantum mechanics at the
time of Hund,38–40 Eq. (70), the eigenstates of chiral molecules form tunnel-
ing doublets of well-defined parity for each state (+ or ) split by a tunneling
splitting ΔE related to the tunneling period τRS for stereomutatio
- Tunneling vs. two minima
The energies of the S and R enantiomers are different due to symmetry viola-
tion
- Symmetries and quantum numbers
- symmetry blocks, pre-BO H2
- n order to recover the classical molecular
structure from a fully quantum mechanical treatment, it
is necessary to obtain for a molecule
(a) the shape;
(b) the handedness: chiral molecules are found exclu-
sively in their left- or right-handed version or in a
classical mixture (called racemic mixture) of these
mirror images but ‘never’ in their superposition;
(c) the individual labelling of the atomic nuclei (distin-
guishability).
